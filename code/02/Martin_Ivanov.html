		<p>The exact date of Vazov's birth is disputed. His parents, Saba and Mincho Vazov, both had a 			lot of influence on the young poet.
		After finishing primary school in Sopot, Mincho sent his son to Kalofer, appointing him assistant 			teacher. Having done his final exams in Kalofer, the young teacher returned to Sopot to help in 		his father's grocery. The next year his father sent him to Plovdiv to Naiden Gerov's school. 			There Vazov made his first steps as a poet.</p>

		<p>He returned to Sopot and then went to Oltenița in Romania to study trade despite his lack 			of interest in it. He was immersed in literature. Soon he left Olteniţa and went to Brăila where 		he met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary and poet. From Brăila he went to Galaţi to his 			uncle where he met Botev again.<p>

		<p>In 1874 he joined the struggle for his country's independence from the Ottoman Empire. He 			returned to Sopot in 1875 where he became a member of the local revolutionary committee. After 			the failure of the April Uprising of 1876, he had to flee the country, going back to Galaţi, 			where most of the surviving revolutionaries were exiled. There he was appointed a secretary of 			the committee.</p>

		<p>Vazov was probably heavily influenced by Botev, who was the ideological leader of the 			Bulgarian revolutionary movement. He started writing his famous poems with Botev and some other 		Bulgarian emigrants in Romania. In 1876 he published his first work, Priaporetz and Gusla, 			followed by "Bulgaria's Sorrows" in 1877.</p>
